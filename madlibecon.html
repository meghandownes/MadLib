<div id="section-in-the-beginning" class="section level1">
<h1>In the Beginning</h1>
<p>Brought forth from the primordial slime by the <span id="out4cd55aa1a3948e4d" class="shiny-html-output"></span>, were the <span id="out24237a28bfa47640" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and the <span id="outdb04649a950f4e8e" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. At first these were the only things in this world. However, the <span id="outd508fabf60075b98" class="shiny-html-output"></span> became a bit bored with their experiment because it seemed as soon as they brought forth <span id="oute9f9379ec3faff8e" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and <span id="out7ab0ea24cbcd7110" class="shiny-html-output"></span>, the creatures died off.</p>
<div id="section-puzzling" class="section level2">
<h2>Puzzling</h2>
<p>Puzzled, the <span id="out904d6558f0905422" class="shiny-html-output"></span> sought out the advice of the <span id="outd82463bb3434512a" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. This was the wisest and most thoughtful of the <span id="out9801b179448a42bf" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. He looked down into the mist of the primordial soup that was the land of <span id="out7278bd7ecbeb06c6" class="shiny-html-output"></span>, and very thoughtfully pointed out that the creatures had nothing to eat, no land, no sky, and no water. The <span id="out6f0d2e1e17026ac4" class="shiny-html-output"></span> pointed them to several well-known texts on the subject of creation, and encouraged them all to go back to basic science, religion, moral philosophy, history, and literature class before they messed around creating their own world.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-so-now-what" class="section level2">
<h2>So Now What?</h2>
<p>So, the <span id="outc87e078850bf3018" class="shiny-html-output"></span> tried again. This time out of the primordial soup they created the firmaments of sky and earth, and brought forth <span id="out4780ccf9eb28f75a" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and <span id="out31ac07b6632e09c3" class="shiny-html-output"></span> in addition to the <span id="out965b062f2d3c9d4d" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and <span id="out24875174e66cf88c" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. This was the beginning of the grand experiment undertaken by the <span id="outb1b304801a496649" class="shiny-html-output"></span> of <span id="outef86620ed1793ed1" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. This new land was rich in resources, a veritable garden of glory. All the requirements for a blissful existence were present in abundance. The <span id="out73077363468be36c" class="shiny-html-output"></span> created two species of interest to their social experiments. These two creatures were to be able to self-replicate and would need to rely on each other for survival.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-interesting-side-note" class="section level2">
<h2>Interesting Side Note</h2>
<p>The <span id="out4d507621c0b655d9" class="shiny-html-output"></span> were <span id="out796d8165071290be" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and became easy prey for the <span id="out5c4432b14d27deef" class="shiny-html-output"></span> <span id="out92952d4d70ca5bdd" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. Since the <span id="out42a78fa430560778" class="shiny-html-output"></span> tasted so good, it was not too long into the experiment that the <span id="outded4434c3cb9d79c" class="shiny-html-output"></span> started specifically breeding the <span id="out160d8acfec7c6a25" class="shiny-html-output"></span> in large farms.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-super-genius" class="section level2">
<h2>Super Genius</h2>
<p>The smartest of the <span id="outca3426809fbab501" class="shiny-html-output"></span> discovered that <span id="out077394f535dac551" class="shiny-html-output"></span> could combine with <span id="out3fefd4889477f13a" class="shiny-html-output"></span> to create food for the <span id="out0b9d35caf079cb54" class="shiny-html-output"></span> to consume. Thus allowing for increased production of <span id="outeebcd45b06052835" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. The <span id="outc43d2a4f9281fb1b" class="shiny-html-output"></span> saw their world had created a system that was self-sustaining. A circular flow of production using the natural inputs to breed more <span id="out787bf386ef4b049c" class="shiny-html-output"></span> that the <span id="out2b9c94a103894528" class="shiny-html-output"></span> could eat. The breeding of the <span id="out174f36bf99884c7a" class="shiny-html-output"></span> allowed more of the <span id="out6d237e5b55c9cc25" class="shiny-html-output"></span> to breed, which then further increased the demand for <span id="out9e36358b8c388546" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. Visually, this population dynamic looked a bit like this:</p>
<p><img src="madlibecon_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>This pleased the <span id="oute0e3145122078330" class="shiny-html-output"></span>, so they decided they would call it quits for a few millenia while they <span id="out1ffcc6c8ecd665a2" class="shiny-html-output"></span> <span id="outbd29813fadf58c1a" class="shiny-html-output"></span> <span id="out20d05aaadb2b090c" class="shiny-html-output"></span> . When the <span id="outc3062de56c320063" class="shiny-html-output"></span> woke up from their college-days shenanigans, they remembered about their experiment. So, down into the <span id="out2628a7a513c35091" class="shiny-html-output"></span> they looked. What they saw surprised them!</p>
<div id="out7690e9bd491f6443" class="shiny-plot-output" style="width: 100% ; height: 400px"></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-toil-and-trouble" class="section level1">
<h1>Toil and Trouble</h1>
<p>As the plot of their experiment showed, in the first few milennia life was good in the <span id="outff6be47c7b809b5e" class="shiny-html-output"></span> . Both <span id="out3f47d10c8c1b6475" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and <span id="out0e07d33f7269aaea" class="shiny-html-output"></span> were thriving. Populations of both species were increasing and food was plentiful.</p>
<div id="section-it-didnt-last" class="section level3">
<h3>It Didn’t Last</h3>
<p>The weather was nice and life carried on uneventfully for many thousands of years. As time went on however, they noticed that things were beginning to change in the <span id="outb45bd5f9d2104dcd" class="shiny-html-output"></span> The<span id="outf9d6d15f5f458848" class="shiny-html-output"></span> were growing faster than the <span id="out79ef171f7b180732" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and the <span id="outa20b7bf62b928ef2" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and <span id="outc8d7e8f3be01ffef" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and <span id="out457b7a833a54c96f" class="shiny-html-output"></span> were becoming more scarce. As the population of <span id="outd2331acb80494da8" class="shiny-html-output"></span> kept increasing they consumed more and more <span id="out09dcb47624992008" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. Then, in the Milennia 10 the system began to breakdown. The population of <span id="outb55c3b11900414e4" class="shiny-html-output"></span> began to crash, followed shortly thereafter by <span id="out55552e1985f3b925" class="shiny-html-output"></span> .</p>
<div id="section-what-had-happened" class="section level4">
<h4>What Had Happened?</h4>
<p>Their beautiful world was now an empty shell of its former self. The <span id="out59abf3e67c83002b" class="shiny-html-output"></span> wondered what went wrong, and if they could stop this “Boom and Bust” cycle from recurring.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-how-to-fix" class="section level3">
<h3>How to Fix?</h3>
<p>So, the wisest among the <span id="out609aff0258501b7a" class="shiny-html-output"></span>, decided that some form of centralized control was required to help stop the <span id="outb17ce92ad35c4e74" class="shiny-html-output"></span> from decimating the population of the <span id="out982e1230e759bd97" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. The <span id="out993aabad39e4b530" class="shiny-html-output"></span> created the Bureau of <span id="out677ca9707d15edae" class="shiny-html-output"></span> <span id="outbe75e64cb06d58b4" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. They appointed the smartest of the <span id="outec66e0ad8eb5bbed" class="shiny-html-output"></span> to oversee the growth, management, and distribution of <span id="out1d7c9e65425e9ed9" class="shiny-html-output"></span> to the population of <span id="out23c723e4a985b7c0" class="shiny-html-output"></span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-command-and-control" class="section level3">
<h3>Command and Control</h3>
<p>The first thing the Bureau of <span id="out403774de92c80a82" class="shiny-html-output"></span> <span id="out0922d9536b8cdfbc" class="shiny-html-output"></span> did, was to lay out how much of <span id="outd8c34779562b3195" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and <span id="outf6acd65ee89b7147" class="shiny-html-output"></span> that the <span id="out7d49a82fe23bb4ef" class="shiny-html-output"></span> would support over a long period of time.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-seeking-guidance" class="section level3">
<h3>Seeking Guidance</h3>
<p>Once again, they felt it wise to consult the <span id="outccab9378f5056a8d" class="shiny-html-output"></span> for advice. The <span id="out07ede05c192456eb" class="shiny-html-output"></span> asked if anyone had studied moral philosophy while they were in college. One <span id="out432c5f6916ae0d95" class="shiny-html-output"></span> raised his <span id="out75a819f2c47a58d5" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. “Good”, said the <span id="out072d941f29a9a58b" class="shiny-html-output"></span>, &quot;You will be the Chief of the <span id="out5c4a0090aad880af" class="shiny-html-output"></span> <span id="out9c3e07f51ba4c07a" class="shiny-html-output"></span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-tools-to-use" class="section level3">
<h3>Tools to Use</h3>
<p>Chief then went back to his abode and began to scratch his noodle (what they call thinking) about the <span id="out33ce9d9ff9f417e9" class="shiny-html-output"></span>. He decided to sketch out his thoughts and do a little math. So, in <span id="out22cc5f77594345a5" class="shiny-html-output"></span> they have two inputs into keeping <span id="outf4a2f81e336eda02" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and <span id="out1b2e7b4fd71f7a12" class="shiny-html-output"></span> alive: (1) <span id="outd6725a018c27b5f4" class="shiny-html-output"></span> and (2) <span id="outaa8cee48283234a2" class="shiny-html-output"></span>.

<h1>But What Does It All Mean?</h1>
<p>Chief was lost. He really did not pay enough attention in college. He knew the propernoun_2 would be sorely dissapointed with him. So, he went back to the drawing board. He reasoned, in our great land the noun_2 need noun_4 and and noun_5 to survive. The noun_2 cannot live without noun_1, even though the noun_1 would probably prefer to live without noun_2!</p>
<p>However, since to keep the noun_2 happy, there have to be a lot of noun_1, and that requires a lot of noun_4 and noun_5. However, I can’t make noun_4 and noun_5 equally. The more the noun_2 produce of noun_4, the less of noun_5 that can be produced.</p>
